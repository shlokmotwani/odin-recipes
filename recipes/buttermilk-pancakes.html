    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!

    </p>
    <p><h2>Buttermilk Pancake Ingredients</h2><br>
        You probably already have everything required to make this top-rated buttermilk pancake recipe. Here's what you'll need:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
            <li>Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
            <li>Salt: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt — the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
            <li>Buttermilk: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
            <li>Milk: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
            <li>Butter: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2>How to Make Buttermilk Pancakes</h2><br>
            It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what to expect:
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
                <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
            </ol>
